ASP.NET Core 3.1 Autorefresh Package
Added Razor Runtime compilation version 3.1.10 using Nuget Package Manager to easily see changes in the View for developers. 

Added Book Model under Models folder with properties and annotations. 
Added Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore for object relational mapping, to access database.
And Sqlserver and Tools for running migrations

Added ConnectionString to appsettings.json file for database connection.

In Startup file, we need to configure ConfigureServices with the entity framework. We need app db context part of the DBContext class.
So we created the ApplicationDbContext.cs file, and then fixed ConfigureServices with the entity framework package in the Startup class. 

Then we used the package manager console and implemented the following commands. Results are shown as below:

Package Manager Console Host Version 5.8.0.6930
